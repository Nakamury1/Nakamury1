## Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 My name is Nakamury1 and I'm a french student in 2nd year in web development at IIM DigitalSchool in Paris.</br>
🎯 I have the ambition to become a full-stack developer. I really enjoy the front-end aspect of web development.

To build a website, I use several tools like:
- Front: HTML, CSS, JS
- Back: Python, PHP, Node.js
- Frameworks: Tailwind, Symfony
- Database: SQL
- Others: Wordpress, Git, SCSS
